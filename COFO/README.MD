## COFO: COFO: COdeFOrces dataset for ProgramClassification, Recognition and Tagging 
COFO: A dataset consisting of _809_ classes/problems with a total of _369K_ source codes, written in _C, C++, Java_ and _Python_ programming languages along with other metadata such as code tags, problem specification, input-output specifications and associates test cases. COFO has been scraped from the openly available [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) website using a selenium-beautifulsoup-python based scraper. The dataset follows a clear directory structure as shown in the figure below and is made publicly available.

# Usage
This dataset can be used in various applications based on Machine Learning, namely Program Classification, Code Tagging, etc.
* For using the dataset in your application, untar [COFO-Dataset.tar](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1Vvv67WJYoJuqF5ZqIS78MFPf3Viuunyb) inside the COFO directory to which you will be redirected to, on clicking the link. The folder is not yet sharable due to obvious reasons but you would be able to view the content 
* Once untarred, you will be able to analyse the dataset and make use of it, following the same directory structure as shown above.
* Not all sub-directories/problems contain programs, written in all programming languages but surely in atleast on of them.
