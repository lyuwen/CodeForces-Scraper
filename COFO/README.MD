# Usage
This dataset can be used in various applications based on Machine Learning, namely Program Classification, Code Tagging, etc.
* The dataset has been stored on cloud, Google Drive and is accessible using the link below.
* For using the dataset in your application, download and untar [COFO-Dataset.tar](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1Vvv67WJYoJuqF5ZqIS78MFPf3Viuunyb) inside the COFO directory on GDrive to which you will be redirected to, on clicking the link. The folder is not yet sharable due to obvious reasons but you would be able to view the content. 
* Once untarred, you will be able to analyse the dataset and make use of it, following the same directory structure as shown above.
* Not all sub-directories/problems contain programs, written in all programming languages but surely in atleast on of them.
